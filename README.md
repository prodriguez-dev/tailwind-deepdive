## Background Classes & Shades

5. Background Classes & Shades
- â€€This set of classes change the background color of an element using a scale of 100-900 for shades and a palette of over 90 shades.

```
.bg-*-{100-900} {}
black, white, gray, red, orange,
yellow, green
```

## Element Sizing & Tailwind's Numbering System

6. Element sizing with REM

- 1 rem = document base font
  - If base font is 16px, then 1rem = 16px
  - Deduce that 20px = 1.25rem
- No decimals in Tailwind's numbering system

7. Tailwind's Numbering System

- 1 rem = 4 in Tailwind (multiplied by 4)
  - If base font is 16px = 1 rem =  4 in Tailwind
  - Example, width of 16px in Tailwind
    - .w-4
  - 1.25 rem = 5 in Tailwind (20px)

8. Element sizing is achieved using the `w-` and `h-` classes.
- All of the numbers in Tailwind are based around the `rem` unit of measurement. `1 rem` is equal to the size of the base font of the document. As an example, if the base font size is 16px then `1 rem` is equal to 16px and we can deduce that `1.25 rem` is equal to `20px` . To help with these fractional numbers, Tailwind's numbered classes are multiplied by 4 to avoid having numbers with decimal places.

9. Tailwind's Numbering System
- Assuming the base font of the document is 16px
  - | Pixels | rem | Tailwind |
    |:------:|:---:|:--------:|
    | 0px | 0 rem | 0 |
    | 4px | 0.25 rem | 1 |
    | 8px | 0.5 rem | 2 |
    | 12px | 0.75 rem | 3 |
    | 16px | 1 rem | 4 |
    | 20px | 1.25 rem | 5 |
    | 24px | 1.5 rem | 6 |
    | 32px | 2 rem | 8 |
    | 40px | 2.5 rem | 10 |
- Continues to all of the available default sizes 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64

10. Sizing with `w-*` and `h-*` classes
```
.w-* {}
.h-* {}
Available sizes in REM
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12,
16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64,
Sizing in percentages
1/2... 1/{3, 4, 5, 6, 12)
